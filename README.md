# Nvidia's HelloAIWorld integration with Isaac

The objective is to adapt the [Nvidia's Hello AI Worl inference tutorial](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference) using the Isacc SDK.
The use case is the Object Detection Program.
The extra constrain is to make the Isaac nodes run on a Jetson nano with a Raspberry Pi Camera
